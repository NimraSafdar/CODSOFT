## Password Generator in Python
### Overview
This Password Generator tool is designed to create strong, randomized passwords based on user preferences. It is built using Python and harnesses the string and random libraries to generate passwords with a combination of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.

### Features
- Custom Password Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password.
- Randomized Password Generation: The tool uses a combination of random characters to generate a password.
- Error Handling: The program ensures users enter a valid number for the password length.
### Instructions
# Requirements:
Python 3.x
# Running the Tool:
- Execute the provided Python script.
- You will be prompted to enter the desired length of the password.
- Ensure to provide a valid number. If the entered length is less than 4, you will be advised to choose a longer length for better security.
- The generated password will be displayed on the screen.
# Implementation Details
The program uses Python's built-in string and random libraries.
Four types of characters are considered for generating passwords:
- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Digits (0-9)
- Symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
The program concatenates these character types into a single string, then randomly selects characters from this combined string to generate the desired password.

## Security Recommendations
Although the tool provides a mechanism to generate random passwords, it's recommended that users ensure the desired length is reasonably long (typically at least 12 characters) to improve security.
It's a good practice to combine this tool with other security measures, such as using a password manager and regularly updating passwords.
